Hired by Space Chimp Media in December, 2014 to
- develop from scratch a responsive UX prototype using HTML, customized CSS / Bootstrap 3, and javascript based off Photoshop wireframes provided by Thanksmama | Birch Baby
- React was still in its infancy, so I used the tried and true PHP methodology to keep track of components

### Technologies used

- Adobe's Photoshop

- Slack
