##Project Scope - early 2015

- Create a responsive site using Photoshop wireframes for reference.

##Project Notes

**Development Notes:**

- All code in this repository was created entirely by me and has been cleared for public viewing by thanksmama.com
- This was my first official Bootstrap project!
- To prevent coding redundancy, I used a simple modular PHP approach that kept the various components separated into snippets.
- Unfortunately (in respect to using this project as a portfolio piece), because Github Pages doesn't work with .PHP, a WAMP environment is required to render the full site.

**Technologies used:**

- HTML5
- LESS | CSS3
- Bootstrap 3
- javascript | jQuery library
- Adobe's Photoshop
- Github
